LLM Burnout Dataset

This repository contains the dataset collected from a survey conducted among 143 students from the Computer Science and Technology, Internet of Things Engineering, and Digital Economy majors at Shandong Institute of Petroleum and Chemical Technology, China. The survey investigates Learning Burnout in the Era of Large Language Models and explores the factors contributing to burnout, its impacts on students' learning experiences, and potential pedagogical responses.

The dataset includes raw survey responses, along with calculated average scores based on a five-point Likert scale. It is designed to facilitate further analysis and research on the effects of Large Language Models on learning burnout. The dataset is publicly available for access and download at this link. It can be freely used for academic research and further study.
